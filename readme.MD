# How to install / run / build

* run `npm install` to fetch dependencies,
* run `npm start` to start local server,
* run `npm run build` to build production app - this will result in creating resources in `/dist` folder
* run `cap:run-android` to build and sync app and run it in an emulator 

Then you only need to update titles, description and apps to start working on your own app.
